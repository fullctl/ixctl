# Mko notes and considerations

- should not be committed into repo but rather addressed

## ports

- only peering (physical) ports can be in DB (all are used in MRTG config gen)
- to add other ports they must be added with some flag and filtered

- not sure about Juniper speeds; et- may be also 40 GE, not always 100 GE /?/
